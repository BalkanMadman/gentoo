# @BLURB: Provides a common set of functions for building NGINX's dynamic modules
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The nginx-module.eclass automates configuring, building and installing NGINX's
# dynamic modules. Using this eclass is as simple as adding 'inherit nginx-module'.
#
# This eclass automatically adds dependencies on NGINX. If the part of the
# module's functionality depends on the NGINX configuration (e.g.
# HMAC generation support depending on http_ssl module being present), the
# corresponding code should be rewritten so that the functionality in question
# (1) is unconditionally enabled/disabled or (2) could be toggled by a USE flag.
# That is, an ebuild author should deduce whether a module actually depends on a
# particular module or on the underlying libraries/APIs. In case of the example
# with HMAC generation, the module actually depends on libcrypto, not the
# http_ssl module, so the ebuild code reflects this.
#
# If the module makes use of the ngx_devel_kit (NDK), it must make sure to add
# ngx_devel_kit to the relevant *DEPEND variables, this eclass automatically
# takes care of the integration details.

# @FUNCTION: econf_ngx
# @USAGE: [<args>...]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Call ./configure, passing the supplied arguments.
# The NGINX's build system consists of many helper scripts, which are executed
# relative to the working directory. Therefore, the function only supports
# executing the configure script from the current working directory. This
# function also checks whether the script is executable. If any of the above
# conditions are not satisfied, the function aborts the build process with
# 'die'. It also fails if the script itself exits with a non-zero exit code,
# unless the function is called with 'nonfatal'.
# If running ./configure is required, this is the way it should be done.
econf_ngx() {
	debug-print-function "${FUNCNAME[0]}" "$@"
	[[ ! -x ./configure ]] &&
		die "./configure is not present in the current working directory or is not executable"
	# We do not use 'edo' here, as it does not quote its arguments when outputting
	# to stderr. This makes it harder to differentiate boundaries between
	# options that are supplied an argument containing whitespace.
	#
	# For example, if edo was used, the following Bash line:
	#     econf_ngx --with-cpp="gcc -E" --builddir=build
	# would be printed to stderr as
	#     ./configure --with-cpp=gcc -E --builddir=build
	# whilst the Bash's "${variable@Q}" syntax automatically quotes `variable`,
	# producing the following result:
	#     ./configure '--with-cpp=gcc -E' '--builddir=build'
	echo "./configure ${*@Q}" >&2
	./configure "$@"
	# For some reason, NGINX's ./configure returns 1 if it is used with the
	# '--help' argument.
	if [[ $? -ne 0 && "$1" != --help ]]; then
		die -n "./configure ${*@Q} failed"

# with the extension ".so"). For some modules, may consist of more than element.
#
# This variable is set in the nginx-module_src_compile() function. Its contents

# Sets required environmental variables required for the build process.

	# Some NGINX modules that depend on ngx_devel_kit (NDK) check whether the
	# NDK_SRCS variable is non-empty and error out if it is empty or not
	# defined. ngx_devel_kit sets this variable during its build but due to the
	# fact that we build modules separately, the dependant module is not build
	# alongside NDK. As a result, the variable is not set and a module halts the
	# build.
	#
	# For all the modules that I have seen, the ones that refer to this variable
	# only check whether NDK_SRCS is non-empty, they do not compare its contents
	# nor alter the variable in any way. Therefore, setting it works around the
	# build failures for the plugins that do check the variable and,
	# subsequently, has no effect on the modules that do not depend on NDK at
	# all or do not check the variable.

	# This variable is mainly checked by modules authored by OpenResty.

# @FUNCTION: nginx-module_src_prepare
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Patches module's initialisation code so that any module's preprocessor
# definitions appear in the separate '__ngx_gentoo_mod_config.h' file inside the
# 'build' directory. This function also makes module's "config" script clear
# whatever content build/ngx_auto_config.h may have at the time of invocation.

	# Since NGINX does not guarantee ABI or API stability, we utilise

	# party modules. As such, we do not want for the dummy preprocessor macros
	# produced by NGINX build system during module compilation to leak into the
	# building environment. However, we do need to "capture" preprocessor macros
	# set by the module itself, so we are required to somehow get these
	# separately.
	#
	# To achieve that, the following sed script inserts ': >
	# build/ngx_auto_config.h' line at the start of a module's 'config' shell
	# script which gets sourced by NGINX build system midway during
	# configuration. It has an effect of truncating the file containing NGINX
	# preprocessor macros. This results in the file containing only module's
	# macros at the end of the module's configuration.
	#
	# The following command renames the file with module's preprocessor macros
	# to __ngx_gentoo_mod_config.h to be later merged with the system NGINX
	# header into the actual header used during compilation. Due to the fact
	# that executing the config shell script is not the last thing that NGINX
	# build system does during configuration, we can not simply rename the
	# header after the whole configuration, as it may contain other preprocessor
	# macros than only the module's ones.

# This assembles ngx_auto_config.h from the system ngx_auto_config.h and
